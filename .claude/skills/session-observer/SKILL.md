description: PROPOSE-ONLY session review — turn what actually happened this session into dated, evidence-backed skill improvement proposals in docs/skill-proposals.md. Never edits a skill, CLAUDE.md, or AGENTS.md itself. Use at the end of a wave, after a correction, or when the operator says "observe this session".

# Session Observer (propose-only)

Compounding upgrade for the skill library: after real work happens, the
session that just lived through it writes down what would have made it
go better — as a **proposal an operator approves**, never as a silent
edit.

## The contract — read before doing anything

> **This skill writes to exactly ONE file: `docs/skill-proposals.md`.**
>
> It MUST NOT edit any `SKILL.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, memory file,
> or installed skill. It MUST NOT install, delete, or reorder skills.

**Why propose-only, not auto-apply.** Skill files steer every future
session. A background process that rewrites them silently is a
self-modifying instruction surface: one bad inference propagates into
every later run with no diff anyone read, and it is a prompt-injection
target (a compromised source becomes permanent instructions). The value
here is the *observation*; the operator keeps the write.

## Run

1. **Gather what actually happened** — no speculation:
   - `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD` and the session's merged PRs
   - files changed, and which verify gates ran (green AND red)
   - **operator corrections**: places the operator said "no", redirected,
     or rejected an approach. These are the highest-signal input.
   - defects found, and whether an existing skill should have caught them
2. **Keep only evidence-backed candidates.** Every proposal needs a
   witnessed trigger from THIS session. If you cannot cite the moment
   that motivated it, drop it — see Traps.
3. **Append one dated block** to `docs/skill-proposals.md` using the
   template below. Append; never rewrite existing blocks.
4. **Report** the count and the single highest-value proposal. Stop
   there — approval is the operator's move.

## Proposal template

```markdown
## 2026-07-30 · <session topic>

### P1 · <target skill or "NEW: <name>">
- **Trigger (witnessed):** what happened, with PR/file/line refs
- **Cost:** what it cost — rework, a wrong claim shipped, minutes lost
- **Proposed edit:** the specific line/rule to add or change
- **Confidence:** high (recurred ≥2×) | medium (once, clear) | low (hunch)
- **Status:** proposed
```

## Traps

- **Inventing improvements.** The failure mode is a tidy list of
  plausible-sounding upgrades nobody's experience motivated. A proposal
  without a citable trigger is slop — this skill exists to capture
  evidence, not to generate advice.
- **Proposing what already exists.** ~1,000 skills are installed and
  repo-level skills sit in `.claude/skills/`. Grep before proposing
  "NEW:" — a duplicate proposal is worse than none. (Pasted plans in this
  repo have come back ~85% already-shipped, four separate times.)
- **Rewriting the queue.** Append-only. The dated history of what was
  proposed and rejected is itself the signal; a rejected idea reappearing
  every wave is the thing you want to be able to see.
- **Silent scope creep into an edit.** If a proposal feels obviously
  right, it is still a proposal. Write it down and stop.

## Approval path (operator)

Review `docs/skill-proposals.md` → for accepted items either edit the
skill directly or hand the proposal to the global `skill-improver`
skill (it iterates against a reviewer agent) → mark the block
`Status: applied <PR>` or `Status: rejected <reason>`.

## When NOT to use

Mid-task — it reads a finished session, so running it early produces
half-evidence. Not for capturing durable operator facts either: those
belong in the memory system (`~/.claude/projects/.../memory/`) and
`.remember/remember.md`, not in a skill-improvement queue.
