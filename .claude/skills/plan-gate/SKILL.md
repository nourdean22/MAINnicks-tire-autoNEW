description: Use when handed a pasted plan, audit, roadmap, or "here's what you should build" from another agent or tool — before doing any of the work. In this repo most such plans are already built; docs/UPSTREAMS.md exists specifically to prove it.

# plan-gate

External plans arriving in this monorepo have a measured failure mode: **most
of the proposal already exists.** `docs/UPSTREAMS.md` opens by recording nine
external audits in two days that re-proposed platforms already adopted, already
rejected with receipts, or already built natively — twelve incumbent-collisions,
each caught only by hand-gating the proposal.

Gate first. Build second. A plan is a hypothesis about what is missing.

## Order of checks

Run these before writing any code or agreeing to any scope.

0. **Re-verify the plan's own claims before anything else — three recurring shapes.**
   (a) A plan carrying its own "verified / ground-truth / fact-base" table gets that table
   re-verified FIRST: self-verification is not evidence, regardless of the tooling the plan
   says it used (2026-08-11: "VERIFIED: Prisma 7 via live code read" vs. installed 6.19.3).
   (b) Any NUMBER a plan builds a phase on ("393 pending", "68 junk wisdoms") gets re-measured
   live: historical snapshots survive in code comments and prior audits long after the state
   they describe has changed — a number quoted in a comment is a fossil, not a reading (three
   independent recurrences). (c) Check production evidence before the doc checks below:
   `/api/version` (or the app's equivalent), `railway status`, and the deployment list — a plan
   gated only against docs while production is actually broken (a 3-day undeployed outage was
   invisible to a 54-section audit that never checked this) ranks the wrong things. This mirrors
   root `AGENTS.md`'s source-of-truth hierarchy: production evidence is rank 1, docs are rank 4-5.
1. **`docs/UPSTREAMS.md`** — the disposition register. If the plan proposes
   adopting an external tool or platform, it very likely has a verdict already.
2. **`apps/<app>/docs/CURRENT-TRUTH.md`** — what is actually live in that app.
   statenour's copy is guarded by `pnpm check:stale-docs`.
3. **`apps/statenour/docs/BLUEPRINT-2026-07-28.md`** — the work-package list.
   Check whether the proposal is an existing WP, and whether that WP is closed.
4. **`git log --oneline -40`** and the memory index — a plan re-proposing last
   week's shipped work is the common case, not the exception.
5. **Only now**, scope what is genuinely new.

## Verdict vocabulary

Reuse `UPSTREAMS.md`'s scorecard rather than inventing terms:

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **ADOPTED** | running in production, receipt linked |
| **NATIVE** | first-party code already covers it; adopting would duplicate a live lane |
| **PATTERN** | took the design, not the dependency |
| **WATCH** | real value, missing prerequisite — state a concrete revisit trigger, never "later" |
| **REJECT** | wrong for this system; state the reason |
| **DEAD** | upstream unmaintained or unverifiable |

## Reporting the gate

State the split explicitly before starting work:

- **Already built** — item, plus the receipt (file, PR, or table) proving it
- **Genuinely new** — the only part worth planning
- **Refuted** — claims the plan asserts that the code contradicts

Name the percentage. "~85% of this plan is already shipped; here are the three
items that are not" is the useful answer, and it is usually the true one.

## When the gate finds something new

Write it up as a work package, then hand off to the normal flow
(`brainstorming` → `writing-plans`). Do not let a pasted plan skip design
review just because it arrived pre-formatted and confident.

## Closing the loop

**When a verdict changes, update `docs/UPSTREAMS.md`.** The register only ends
the re-proposal loop if it stays current — an unrecorded rejection gets
re-proposed next month by the next tool.
