# Truth OS — nickstire.org (living snapshot)

**Purpose:** Single place to record what must be **true in production** for this repo. Update when you ship behavior or infra changes.

## Canonical business facts (code)

- **Address:** `17625 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44112` — source: `shared/business.ts` (`BUSINESS.address`).
- **Phone:** `(216) 862-0005` — source: `shared/business.ts`.
- **Public site:** `SITE_URL` env, default `https://nickstire.org`.
- **Review marketing line:** `BUSINESS.reviews` (`rating`, `count`, `countDisplay`) — keep aligned with GBP; live API + admin overrides in `shop_settings` when configured.

## Deploy

- **nickstire.org:** Railway (not Vercel for this app).
- **Build:** `pnpm run build`; full static SEO path: `pnpm run build:prerender`.

## Migrations pending awareness

- **`0026_work_order_items_decline_recovery.sql`** — adds `decline_outreach_*` and `decline_recovered_at` on `work_order_items` for declined-work recovery tracking. Apply to prod DB before relying on outreach/recovered fields.

## Invariants (do not break)

- **ShopDriver / ALG** integration is load-bearing for shop operations — do not remove without explicit owner decision.
- **Feature flags:** risky features should default off at the code path until explicitly enabled in DB.
